Elasticsearch-Azure-PAAS
========================

This is a Visual Studio project for creating an [Elasticsearch](http://http://www.elasticsearch.org) cluster on Microsoft Azure using worker roles.

Who is this for?
---------------------------
This is for people who want to run Elastic search on Azure in the Platform as a Service enviroment. This is also an opportunity to test Elasticsearch in a simulated distributed environment. 

How does this work?
----------------------
This is a visual studio project which can serve as a base for a solution based on an Elasticsearch cluster. The intent is to handle all the different aspecs of setting up and managing a cluster
* Installation 
* Configuration
* Plugin Setup
* Logging
* Snapshots
* Automatic Node Discovery
* Security

Do I need an Azure Account to try this?
---------------------------------------
No, it runs in the full Azure Emulator on your desktop. The project is designed to work with azure files service for data and snapshots but falls back to a resource folder in the Azure Emulator. Other than that, there is no significant difference between running this project on the Azure Emulator and publishing it to Azure. 


Running the project
-------------------
I tried my best to allow someone to clone this project and run it without doing any configuration. Unfortunately, there are a couple config steps before you can run it either in the Azure Emulator or in an Azure Cloud Service. The many configuration values are needed for the role to download and install java, then download, configure and run Elasticsearch. The default download location for Elasticsearch is their main download link so you don't need to configure that if you are just testing. For Java on the other hand, I could not find a link that didn't require me to visit a page and accept a license. This is also the case with the OpenJDK distribution. So the quickest way to get this project going is to upload the java jdk installer (jdk-8u25-windows-x64.exe) to the development storage account into a conainter called "installers" and run the cloud project.

1. Clone the project
2. Restore the Nuget packages
2. Download the java jdk installer and copy it to a url accessible to the role or copy it to the storage account associated with the role. 
  2. If you copied the installer to a storage account 
    3. Copy the full storage url to the role setting "JavaDownloadURL" (default:http://127.0.0.1:10000/devstoreaccount1/installers/jdk-8u25-windows-x64.exe)
    4. Change the role setting "JavaDownloadType" to "storage" (default:storage)
    5. The role will look for the file in the storage account created from the connection string "StorageConnection" (default: Develoment Storage)
  5. If you copied the installer to a regular website or a storage url that can be accessed publicly
    6. Copy the full url to the role setting "JavaDownloadURL"
    7. Change the role setting "JavaDownloadType" to "web" (default:storage)
8. Set the role setting "JavaInstallerName" to the name of the exe you downloaded. (default: jdk-8u25-windows-x64.exe)
9. You have the option of leaving the defaults for Elasticsearch and it will download the zip file from the Elasticsearch website. If not, you can download the elasticsearch zipfile and set the corresponding config settings just like you did for java
10. Once the project knows the names of the installers/packages it will be using and their download locations you can run the project using the full emulator.
11. You should see two elasticsearch console windows open ~~with logging information~~. 
12. To check if discovery is working, open the following url in your browser or fiddler: http://localhost:9200/_nodes
  13. When Elasticsearch has properly initialized, it should show two nodes.

The Discovery Plugin
-----------------------
The discovery plugin gets information about the role instances from the webrole using named pipes. I would have used the java azure sdk Runtime api but the named pipe it depends on is only available when using the ProgramEntryPoint option. The code can be viewed in the [Elasticsearch-Azure-PAAS-Plugin](https://github.com/garvincasimir/Elasticsearch-Azure-PAAS-Plugin) repository. There is lots of cleaning to be done. 

Other Useful Plugins
-----------------------
Although I want to keep this project as generic as possible, if anyone has suggestions for plugins that everyone should definitely be using let me know.
